# Rails 4.2 Baseline

This gem is a wrapper of a Rails Applications Template to create a new Rails 4.2 application based on the normal practices in [cloudcoder.com.my](http://cloudcoder.com.my). Just go through a simple wizard to get all the gems set and you'll be good to proceed with migrations and start coding your project.

This gem is heavily based on [rails_wizard](https://github.com/intridea/rails_wizard) for the overall idea of the gem and refers to [rails-composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer) for the code organization.

## Installation

    $ gem install rails_baseline

## Usage

Create a new Rails app:

    $ rails_baseline new APP_NAME

Please replace APP_NAME with your new Rails app name.

List out all available recipes:

    $ rails_baseline list
